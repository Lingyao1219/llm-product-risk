"I write cosmic horror stories. The four recent stories on my page are from a series called ""Whispers of the Black Horizon,"" which I originally created seven years ago. I recently uploaded the documents outlining my series framework to o1 Pro; it gave me many ways to improve the series, like reducing repetitiveness and keeping reader interest. After making improvements, I switched to Claude as the editor.

Chatgpt isn’t the tool people use to extract the data - it’s the one that compiles it all together.
